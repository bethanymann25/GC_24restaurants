<h1>THE 24 BEST SUSTAINABLE AND ECO-FRIENDLY RESTAURANTS IN NYC</h1>

<body>
    <p>One of the perks of living in New York, is that there are just too many farm-to-table and organic restaurants to name. But if you’re looking for a bucket list of amazing dining experiences or a short list of places to try on your vacation, this is it. I’ll be totally up front with you: I haven’t been to every restaurant on this list (exactly half, actually), because I have a budget and a life. The ones I haven’t personally dined at, I added due to my extensive research, personal recommendations from friends, and the number of times I’ve just generally heard its name.</p>

<P>But believe me, I WILL visit every one of these before I die. You want to go with me?</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.abchome.com/dine/abc-kitchen/">ABC Kitchen</a>-USQ</h2>
<p>You wouldn’t think a restaurant attached to a furniture store would be all that great, but ABC is no regular furniture store. It’s pretty much New York City’s flagship high-end furniture, home decor, and rug store, with an amazing selection of made-in-America and eco-friendly items. That ethos extends to the restaurant, which is of course impeccably decorated. But that’s besides the point. The real point is the seasonal menu of beautiful and delicious entrees you’ll be thinking about for months afterward, served on handcrafted plates on a locally-made table. Flip over the menu and you’ll find more information than you would ever need about where your food comes from. The fact that you might run into a celebrity on your way out the door is just a perk. Read my full review.</p>

<h2><a href="http://lighthousebk.com/">Lighthouse</a>-Williamsburg</h2>
<p>Located just two blocks away from our apartment, Lighthouse was my and my husband’s go-to brunch, dinner, and cocktail spot before we even realized it was so sustainable! Owner Naama Tamir is passionate about holistic sustainability, and heads up the sustainability initiatives for the Williamsburg/Greenpoint bar tradegroup BABAR. A low-waste restaurant, Lighthouse serves cocktails with reusable metal straws, separates out organic waste to give to a friend for natural dying, sends the rest of the organic waste away with BK Rot, provides used bottles to another friend for their candle company, and provides their old oyster shells to the Billion Oyster Project. They serve food sourced from local farms, use nontoxic cleaning products, and employ a nontoxic pest control company. Every detail of reducing their negative impact on the earth has been thought of. Those paper napkins they use? Those help the compost, which needs paper and wood chips to balance out the wet food waste. There’s also Lighthouse Outpost in Manhattan to try.</p>

<h2><a href="http://robertaspizza.com/">Robrtta's</a>-Bushwick</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with the West Village restaurant Rosemary’s (I’ll get to that one in a sec), this thoroughly Bushwick restaurant has become a destination for those seeking locally-sourced comfort food with a cool crowd. Roberta’s solidified its hip factor by hosting the famous Tiki Disco parties in its backyard. But the food is enough in of itself for a visit down the L line. The crisp pizza is topped from local ingredients, some sourced right from Roberta’s back yard. The ribs are orgasmic. In the summer, pass the time waiting for a coveted table by grabbing a beer or cocktail from the tiki bar out back and ordering some apps.</p>

<h2><a href="http://rosemarysnyc.com/">Rosemary's</a>-West Village</h2>
 <p>For a more glamorous farm-to-table experience, visit this spacious restaurant (which is always overcrowded anyway). There’s no reservations, so bring a comfy pair of shoes so you can set up with a glass of wine or beer (no cocktails) and some tapas at the communal standing table by the bar and discuss the fact that Rosemary’s has a rooftop garden. The food is well worth the infuriating wait, with gorgeous flavors in affordable pasta dishes. Despite this, the crowd is well-heeled, and if you’re lucky, you’ll overhear some entertaining wannabe-1%er conversations while you eat.</p>   
    
<img src="4diner.jpg" alt="4diner">
<h2><a href="http://dinernyc.com/">Diner</a>-Williamsburg</h2>
<p>The genesis of the Diner empire, which includes other notable restaurants like Marlow and Sons, and the market Marlow and Daughters a couple doors down, this restaurant is all about knowing where your meat comes from. For 15 years, it’s been the go-to for Williamsburg residents, and a destination for anyone else in the know. The spoken-word menu changes almost daily, with satisfying entrees and tasty cocktails. There are vegetarian options, but this place is for unpretentious meat lovers. I mean, it’s not like the decor is fancy (it really is in a barely renovated old diner) but it’s Brooklyn, so who cares?</p>
